# 👋 Hi there! I'm Bryan Perdomo

Welcome to my GitHub profile — where ideas turn into solutions.

## 🧠 About Me

I'm a low-code solutions builder with a strong focus on workflow automation, document processing, and integration platforms like SharePoint and Workflow. I love turning business requirements into working prototypes (and scaling them into polished products).

Currently building tools that simplify complex processes using:
- ⚙️ JavaScript, Power Automate, React, .NET, and workflow engines
- 📄 PDF processing, OCR, HWR, and intelligent form extraction
- 🔗 APIs, low-code SDKs, and custom integrations

## 🔭 Projects I'm Proud Of

- **⚽ MatchPro** - Web-based application for soccer tournament directors and team managers
- **🧾 Logistics BOL Extractor** – React/.NET app using AI for extracting shipping documents  
- **📬 Email Validator** – Standalone script to send test emails & check bounce status  
- **🧩 Workflow Demos** – Showcasing Integrify capabilities with dynamic task routing
